# hwTriviaGame

## Trivia Game with a Harry Potter theme.

## Description 
This Project emphasizes JQuery, JS Timers, the the Fisher Yates randomization technique. It also utilizes an Array > JS Object > Array > JS Object to provide detail on questions. This has built in extensibility to allow for the marking of a question as played so as not to repeat it. This hasn't been implmented, but is part of a future-facing, multi-round game capability with many more questions to choose.  Project uses Bootstrap and Custom css stylesheet for styling.

## Getting Started

Make a fork of this project to your own repository and clone it to your workspace. Links to JQuery and Bootstrap libraries included.  No other installation steps needed.

### Prerequisites
Preferably a desktop or notebook device. 
Chrome browswer (preferred) or Firefox.

All code is tested against Chrome and Firefox's latest versions. No tests have been made against IE or Safari. However, code is based on compatibility to both browsers (IE version 10 or higher or Microsoft Edge recommended). Game does have sizing responsiveness, but playability deteriorates at mobile device levels. Media query to remove image backgrounds would improve this.
